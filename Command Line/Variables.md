Variable -  container in which you can store values to be later retrieved. assign a value to a variable using the = operator, if no value is assigned it will evaluate to undefined
    To create a variable, you use the keywords below followed by the name of the variable
        let - can be redefined and left undefined
        var - Similar to let but varies in scope (not recommended for use) 
        const - cannot be left undefined and cannot be redefined

naming variable - since no space are allowed between a variable, there is 2 conventional ways to name variable. make sure you're always using the standard camelCase for Javascript!
    Camel Case - thisIsUsingCamelCase (note the first letter is not capitalized)
    Snake Case - this_is_using_snake_case

undefined - types of value to variable declared but not assigned any value
    NOTE: different from 'not defined' which is a variable that was not declared but used anyways

null - a value that refers to nothing

Modifying Variables - assign a new value to a variable at any time by using the assignment operator =. This will overwrite the old value of that variable. 

Shorthand Updates
    num = num + 1 can be written as num += 1. This extends to -=, *=, /=

console.log - command that allows you to display variables or values when running you code or node

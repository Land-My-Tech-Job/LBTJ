troubleshooting for Git
    committing 
        pwd - this is to make sure you are in the right directory
        ls - list the file directories that are in the current folder (good for letting you know where to cd into)
        git status - show you the status of the tracked repo, tell you what is being tracked and what is ready for commit
        git branch - list all the current local branch of the repository
        git branch -D - force delete a branch (unsaved changes will be discarded)
        git branch nameOfBranch - create a branch named nameOfBranch
        git checkout -b nameOfBranch - create AND switch to nameOfBranch
        git checkout nameOfBranch - switches to nameOfBranch

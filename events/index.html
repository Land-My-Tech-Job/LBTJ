<!-- 
JavaScript events provide a way for you to trigger an action in your program when certain things happen. 
The most common type of event is probably the click, which occurs when someone clicks on something 

An event listener is basically a non-blocking infinite loop with a callback function, and when it "hears" an event, it triggers the callback function. 
It sits and waits until it's called.

DOMContentLoaded is the event fired every time the HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed.

Much of our code will always be inside a callback to this function because we can't manipulate the DOM until the document object has been fully built.
